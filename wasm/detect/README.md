# example - Web Audio + p5.js example

Hints on creating wasm modules:

bind functions in EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS section at end of audio_processor.cc
todo: figure out details of channel count

Run `python -m http.serverr` in this directory.

Then visit `localhost:8000` with Google Chrome (need to test others).
