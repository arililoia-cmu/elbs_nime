# Exploiting Latency In The Design Of A Networked Music Performance System For Percussive Collective Improvisation

## Setup

Notes on [google cloud host](https://console.cloud.google.com):

Created micro instance in Oregon

Edited "default" ingress http rule to include ports 80,8000,8080

Used network connectivity to create a test, but once it was working, I could also easily test with `python3 -m http.server`

SSH to instance using a browser pop-up SSH window available in `console.cloud.google.com` -- login is automated.
